     * store. In order to run the application bring up the event store in another window (you can use
     * default arguments eg EventStore.ClusterNode.exe) then you can run this application with it. Once 
     * this program is running you can run the WritingEvents sample to write some events to the stream
     * and they will appear over the catch up subscription. You can also run many concurrent instances of this
     * program and each will receive the events over the subscription.
